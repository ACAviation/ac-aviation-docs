<p>An audit is scheduled check of ACA departmental operations or our

ACA or our contract services provider&#8217;s processes, policies or

requirements.</p>
<p>ACAs audits may also include compliance monitoring.  A compliance
monitoring audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with CAAT
requirements.</p>
<p>Audits are used to confirm that processes, policies, resources,

operation. The main purpose of an audit is to identify unsatisfactory
practices before they cause an accident. Audits will be carried out in
accordance with the Audit Schedule.</p>

Quality Audit or Inspection Form is required and shall be delivered to
the Head of Quality within 48hr of completing the Audit.</p>

Schedule, if required; changes are to be effected through the Quality
Assurance Committee review process.</p>

<h2>Specialist Advice<a class="headerlink" href="#specialist-advice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ACA Auditors and Inspectors cannot be experts in every field related
to the operational environment. It is important that they realize
their limitations. When necessary, they must be willing to consult
with other professionals during an audit or evaluation. ACA may
utilize the following specific sources of information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mandatory reporting programs;</li>
<li>Voluntary Reporting Program;</li>
<li>The external audit process;</li>
<li>Accident and incident investigations;</li>
<li>Data analysis;</li>
<li>Change management;</li>
<li>Internal Audit and Inspections;</li>
<li>Continuous Monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p>ACA actively seeks the information necessary to confirm the successful
operation of our QAS processes. Continuous monitoring involves
analysis of operational data as it becomes available. The operational
data is continually monitored to discover any pertinent trends. The
Head of Quality is responsible to monitor this information and
accomplish this review on a weekly basis.</p>

<h2>ACA Audit Program<a class="headerlink" href="#aca-audit-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ACA&#8217;s Quality Assurance System (QAS) and Compliance Monitoring (CM)
audit programs aim is to improve ACA&#8217;s by raising the quality and
compliance standards of all ACA departments and contract service
providers.  The QAS / CM audit program compare the performance of all
ACA departments and contract service providers by scoring them against
the estimated compliance or non-compliance severity table. All ACA
departments and contract service providers are expected to attain
levels of at least compliance with the compliance or non-compliance
severity table. ACA&#8217;s QAS / CM audit program are meant to help and
encourage all ACA departments and contract service providers to
achieve levels of compliance. The non-compliance process describes how
the ACA deals with departments and contract service providers that do
not achieve compliance.</p>
<p>The Quality Assurance System Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3 contains
an Estimated Concern or Non Compliance Severity Values that consists
of values of A, B, C, D and E. The Auditor or Inspector will circle
that value that, in their judgment, indicates that the area that was
audited was found to be compliant or non-compliant. The auditor or
inspector will then add the discrepancies that were found and what
they believe is the root cause of the discovered
non-compliance(s). The audit or inspection will be considered a pass
if NO non-compliance(s) are found. The audit or inspection will be
considered a fail if any non-compliance(s) are found.</p>
<p>Note: Form QAS-3 will be used for Quality Audits / Inspections and
Compliance Audits / Inspections.</p>
<p>The Nominated Person, Department Manager or Supervisor will be
notified of passing or failing the audit or inspection. Any ACA
departments and contract service providers which fail an audit or
inspection to adequately address all non-compliance&#8217;s within the
agreed upon corrective action and implantation time frame that has
been agreed upon by the Quality Assurance Committee.</p>
