<h1>Inspections<a class="headerlink" href="#inspections" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>All departments within the ACA are subject to be inspected. An
inspection is unscheduled or unannounced check of ACA departmental
operations or our contract services providers operations. The
inspection confirms that ACA or our contract services provider&#8217;s
processes, policies or procedures are compliant with ACA standards and
compliant with CAAT requirements. The main purpose of an inspection is
to identify unsatisfactory practices before they cause an accident.</p>
<p>ACA&#8217;s QAS inspection program aim is to improve ACA&#8217;s by raising the
quality standards of all ACA departments and contract service
providers by auditing, inspecting and monitoring their processes,
policies and procedures. The QAS inspection program compares the
performance of all ACA departments and contract service providers by
scoring them against the estimated compliance or non-compliance
severity table. All ACA departments and contract service providers are
expected to attain levels of at least compliance with the compliance
or non-compliance severity table. ACA&#8217;s QAS inspection program is
meant to help and encourage all ACA departments and contract service
providers to achieve levels of compliance. The non-compliance process
describes how the ACA deals with departments and contract service
providers that do not achieve compliance.</p>
<p>The Quality Assurance System Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3 contains
Compliance or Estimated Non Compliance Severity Values that consists
of values of A, B, C, D and E. The Auditor or Inspector will circle
that value that, in their judgment, indicates that the area that was
inspected was found to be compliant or non-compliant. The auditor or
inspector will then add the discrepancies that were found and what
they believe is the root cause of the discovered
non-compliance(s). The audit or inspection will be considered a pass
if NO non-compliance(s) are found. The audit or inspection will be
considered a fail if any non-compliance(s) are found.</p>

<div class="section" id="data-gathering-guidelines">
<h2>Data Gathering Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#data-gathering-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>The conduct of the inspection is to include the following considerations.</p>
<p>The Inspector is responsible for ensuring the inspection achieves the
required objectives.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Follow the inspection plan as closely as possible.</li>
<li>Answer all the questions on the Audit or Inspection Checklist Form, QAS-2.</li>

Form, QAS-2 and Audit or Inspection Form, QAS-3.</li>
<li>Schedule Inspection update meetings with the Head of Quality to ask
questions or take council.</li>
<li>If the inspection takes longer than one day, the Inspector is to
provide a summary of the daily findings to the responsible Nominated
Persons, department managers or supervisors.</li>
<li>The use of &#8220;guides&#8221; to introduce Inspectors to required personnel,
locate particular documentation and answer any questions, is generally
a normal practice, however, they can be externally valuable as
witnesses when nonconformities are identified. The role of the
&#8220;guides&#8221; is to ensure that the Inspectors are able to move around
freely, are accompanied at all times to meet with company
confidentiality and health and safety requirements and to ensure that
fair play prevails.</li>
<li>Provide positive reactions and comments of findings to the responsible
Nominated Persons, managers or supervisors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should any other aspects be observed which whilst not being
nonconformity could be a cause for concern; these are to be reported
immediately to the responsible Nominated Person, department manager or
supervisor.</p>
<p>All the findings are to be collected together, utilizing the, Audit or

Audit or Inspection Report Form QAS-4.</p>
