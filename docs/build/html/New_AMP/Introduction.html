<h3>E. How To Use The Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#e-how-to-use-the-schedule" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The intent of this Maintenance Program is to provide AC AVIATION
Company with the option of selecting the maintenance plan best suited
to their own flying schedule. The charts shown in Figure 1 and Figure
2 are used in selecting the inspection method chosen.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For composition of schedules and breakdown refer to
paragraphs 3 and 4.</p>
</div>
<p>It is the responsibility of AC AVIATION Company, those subsequent
maintenance recommendations, including airworthiness information
promulgated in Service Bulletins, Service Letters, etc., issued by the
constructors and vendors should be evaluated and, where appropriate,
should be incorporated in this Schedule by the approved amendment
procedures.</p>
<p>The requirements of this Schedule shall normally be implemented at or
before the periods specified. Extensions to prescribed periods are
subject to agreement with the CAAT and should be made only when the
periods cannot be complied with due to circumstances which could not
have been reasonably foreseen by AC AVIATION Company or by AC AVIATION
Companyâ contracted Maintenance Organization.</p>
<div class="section" id="maintenance-start-data">
<h4>Maintenance Start Data<a class="headerlink" href="#maintenance-start-data" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>All the tasks in the Out of Phase, Component Requirements and
Airworthiness Limitations Document (ALD) are calculated as starting
from the date of original certification (issuance of original standard
airworthiness certificate) or from component installation during
completion. CAAT or applicable regulatory required inspections and
maintenance must be done in accordance with specific regulatory
requirements. All Hawker Beechcraft Corporation recommended
inspections, maintenance and servicing shall be based on the date of
release for service following aircraft completion. These statements
are not applicable to the airplane engines or the APU, which must be
maintained in accordance with their own manufacturers, recommended or
required maintenance instructions.</p>
<p>The airplane must be maintained in accordance with the Maintenance
Schedule based on original certification during completion. Both a 400
hour Detailed Walk-Around Inspection and 12 month (E Inspection) are
required at the time of completion if the difference between the date
of original certification and completion is more than six months or if
the airplane has more than 50 hours total flight time.</p>
<p>Any variation to the inspection must be approved by CAAT.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The requirements referred to in this Maintenance Schedule
are applicable to equipment installed to Hawker Beechcraft
Corporation and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation Completion
Center approved modifications. For airplanes with equipment
installed to any other FAA approved modifications refer, to
that particular Design Authority responsible for the
installation. Refer to the relevant Vendor Publication for
any Servicing/Maintenance instructions which are not
specifically defined in this schedule.</p>

<dt>Flying Times</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">All periods quoted in the Schedule in &#8216;flying hours&#8217;
are based on flight (take-off to touch-down) times. Where, due to
airport congestion, block (chock-to-chock) times exceed flight
times by an average of more than 20 per cent, corresponding
adjustments should be made to the overhaul periods of selected
components such as starter/generators, hydraulic pumps and cut-out
valves.</p>

<dt>Fatigue Lives and Mandatory Limitations</dt>
<dd><p class="first">ALL registered airplanes must comply with the requirements of CAAT</p>
<p>All other life limitations classified as mandatory by the
constructor/manufacturer must also be observed unless varied by
CAAT.</p>
<p>The Structural Inspection frequencies quoted in this Schedule are
based on a set of assumed typical operating conditions. These
assumptions take into account the experience obtained in service
with the earlier variants of airplanes together with the enhanced
capabilities of the Hawker 800XP Aircraft.</p>
<p>The projected utilization has been described in the form of Flight
Plans or Mission Profiles; whilst these have been invested with a
degree of conservatism it is not possible for AC AVIATION Company
to make sure that they will cover every airplane in service.</p>
<p>Should the actual utilization differ significantly from the
assumed mission profiles then due allowance must be made for the
effects on the structural damage tolerance and fatigue
characteristics and, hence, the inspection and replacement
schedules.</p>
<p>For the purposes of compiling the Structural Inspection
frequencies the typical mission profiles allow for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One cabin pressurization to full differential (8.55 psi).</li>
<li>One full cycle of flap operation (take-off and landing).</li>
<li>One full undercarriage cycle including braked, full stop landing per
flight where a flight is defined as a single completed take-off and
landing sequence. Touch and go landings, or rollers, are considered to
be equivalent to full stop landings for maintenance purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also assumed that the majority of flights are at altitudes of
25,000 feet and above using normal climb and descent procedures, with
an allowance for flights at lower altitudes. The rate of fatigue
damage to the structure could be greater than predicted for the
assumed typical utilization if more than 30% of the flights involve
cruises at altitudes below 15,000 feet or if less than 70% of the
flights involve cruises at or above 25,000 feet.</p>
<p>The assumed typical block time for average flights is 1.5
hours. Fatigue damage per flight could be increased if on average,
more than 70% of flights are of a longer duration.</p>
<p>If AC AVIATION Company finds that the utilization of their aircraft
differ from the average conditions outlined above should contact
Hawker Beechcraft Corporation for guidance.</p>
<p>In order to fully describe AC AVIATION Company particular usage of our
airplane the following information is required:</p>
