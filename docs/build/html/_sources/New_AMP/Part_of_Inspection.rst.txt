Preamble
--------

The PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS supersede and replace the PRE-FLIGHT INSPECTION
which was previously listed in the Hawker 800XP AIRCRAFT FLEXIBLE
MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.

It is the responsibility of the Flight Crew and Pilot-in-Command to
ensure the items contained within are accomplished before flight. The
Flight Crew or appropriately rated maintenance personnel may
accomplish all items. It is recommended that these pages be
photocopied and used as a check-off sheet prior to each flight.

.. NOTE:: Requirements marked with(preceding the check) need only be
          completed once daily, before the first flight.

.. NOTE:: These checks should be done prior to and in conjunction with
          the External Checks and Internal Checks listed in the Normal
          Procedures section of Approved Airplane Flight Manual.

.. NOTE:: Refer to Figure 1 or Figure 2 (as applicable) — Recommended
          Walk-Around Sequence.
