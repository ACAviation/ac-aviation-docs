 AC Aviation QAS Compliance Monitoring Training
================================================

ACA's compliance monitoring program involves the evaluation of our
processes, policies or procedures to ensure compliance with applicable
rules and regulations of CAAT, State and local laws.  This will be
accomplished by incorporating compliance monitoring when conducting
quality audits and inspections of ACA departments and ACA's contract
service providers.

ACAâ€™s compliance monitoring also involves daily compliance monitoring
by all ACA employees. All operational employees are encouraged to
perform daily compliance monitoring in their assigned duties. If an
employee discovers a non-compliant area they should inform their
immediate supervisor or file a non punitive written report
(Non-compliance Report QAS-1 or a Suggestion Form).

Identifying non-compliant areas is an important step in preserving
ACAs well being and can also help prevent accidents or incidents.
