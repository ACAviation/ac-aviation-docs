Introduction
============

The Quality Assurance Manual enables AC Aviation to monitor compliance
with CAAT requirements and the guidance set forth in ICAO Doc 9859
AN/474, (Quality Assurance Manual QAM) and the AOC issue by the CAAT.

AC Aviation has taken into account human factors principles when
creating the QAM.  The Head of Quality shall ensure that the QAM is
maintained in a form in which it can be used without difficulty.

AC Aviation shall utilize our Quality Assurance System (QAS) to assess
reported or discovered non-compliance related to AC Aviation flight
and maintenance operations.

AC Aviation QAS addresses the formal and systematic approach to
overall quality and its related processes and activities rather than
occupational quality, environmental protection, or customer service
quality.

AC Aviation will provide oversight for the quality of our contracted
service providers policies and procedures.  The Head of Quality will
schedule audits and coordinated inspections for all contracted service
providers to ensure compliance with AC Aviation quality standards.

AC Aviation understands that we may issue a Quality Assurance Manual
in separate volumes.  With the approval of the Authority, copies of
the Quality Assurance Manual may be distributed to Company personnel
in an electronic format which may be accessed through AC Aviation
employee’s website.

Company Legal Business Name
===========================

AC Aviation is the Company’s legal business name: however, the acronym
of ACA shall be used in this Quality Assurance Manual when referring
to AC Aviation.

Common Language
===============

This entire Quality Assurance Manual has been prepared in accordance
with ISO 9001/ Quality Management and Part M as specified is in the
English language.  Should it become necessary for AC Aviation to
produce a new Quality Assurance Manual or major parts of the Quality
Assurance Manual, it will be prepared in the English language.

ACA understands that with the approval of the Authority we may
translate and use the manual or parts thereof, into another language
to ensure that that all personnel are able to understand parts of the
QAM that pertain to their duties and responsibilities.

Changes to ACA's AOC

specifications that have been triggered by discoveries through a
quality audit or inspection will require approval by CAAT.

The Revision Process
====================

When a revision is required, Nominated Persons or the person
overseeing the department may request a revision to the ACA QAM.  The
person will forward the revision request to the Head of Flight
Operations and the Head of Quality stating the reason for the
revision.

If a person overseeing the department requests a revision, they will
follow their chain of command as depicted in the QAS, Organization and
Responsibilities section, Organization Structure Diagram.

As an example, the Head of Quality may require a change to ACA's to
Risk Assessment process. The Head of Quality will advise the Head of
Flight Operations of the revision. The Head of Flight Operations will
call a Quality Assurance Committee meeting to discuss and deliberate
ACA's Risk Assessment process.

Once the revision of policies and or procedures has been agreed upon
by the Quality Assurance Committee, the Head of Quality will compose
the revision and then email or disseminate a draft of the revision to
the Quality Assurance Committee for review. The Quality Assurance
Committee may request changes or clarification on the drafts policies
and procedures. The Head of Quality is responsible for the changes or
any required clarification. Once a final draft is agreed upon, the
Head of Quality will forward the revision to the Head of Flight
Operations who in term will alert all affected employees of the
revision via email or via the ACA employee website. All affected
employees will print of the revision, sign and date the revision and
forward the signed revision to their immediate supervisor. The
supervisor will forward all employees signed revision to the Nominated
Person overseeing the department. Nominated Person's will advise the
Head of Quality of all signed revisions and place all signed revisions
in the employee file which will be kept until the employee leaves ACA.

-------------------------------------------------------
Revision Notification Process of Employees at Home Base
-------------------------------------------------------

Employees will read or be briefed in shift beginning department
meeting prior to starting their work day.

.. note:: Revisions may be electronically signed if approved by the

If an employee is late in signing a revision, the Nominated Person
overseeing the department will contact the employee to see if the
employee required clarification of the revision. Al employees are
required to sign each revision. The Nominated Person must ensure the
employee signs each QAM revision and will make clear to the employee
that the revision is "Quality Related" and important to the overall
quality level of the ACA. The employee may request a meeting with the
Flight Operations and Head of Quality if theydisagree with the
revision.

.. Note:: The person that is requesting the revision will be
          responsible for composing the draft and the dissemination of
          the draft to all Nominated Persons and will see the revision
          process through to completion.

.. Note:: The QAS may be in an electronic format if approved by the
          Authority.

The Head of Flight Operations and the Head of Quality will maintain an
up-to-date list of QAS manuals, together with copy numbers and
locations or the name or title of the manual holder. It is the
responsibility of the Head of Flight Operations and the Head of
Quality to ensure that sufficient additional copies will be provided
to ACA staff to ensure that all personnel have ready access to the QAS
when required.

check the company website and contact dispatch at the beginning of the
duty day and confirm the flights status and if there are any new
revisions to the QAM. If there is a new revision, the Pilot-in-Command
and Flight Crew will print off a copy of the new revision and review
it and sign the revision prior to engine start.

The Pilot-in-Command shall ensure that a copy of all signed
revision(s) are onboard the aircraft prior to engine start.

The Pilot-in-Command will turn in all signed revisions to dispatch
when returning to home base with the Journey Log(s) and any other
records or logs.

.. Note:: Revisions may be electronically signed if approved by the
          Authority.

page of the QAM.

All text revisions will be indicated by a single black change bar
located in the right margin of the page The revision change bar will
be removed when the section is revised again. Only the most current
revision will have the text border.
