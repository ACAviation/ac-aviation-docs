Preamble
--------

The POST FLIGHT CHECKS supersede and replace the POST FLIGHT
INSPECTION which was previously listed in the Hawker 800XP AIRCRAFT
FLEXIBLE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.

It is the responsibility of the Pilot-in-Command and Flight Crew to
make sure the items contained within are accomplished after the last
flight of the day. The Flight Crew or appropriately rated maintenance
personnel may accomplish all items. It is recommended these pages be
photocopied and used as a check-off sheet after the last flight of the
day.

.. NOTE:: Requirements marked withpreceding the check indicate items
          which have the potential to cause delays if not corrected
          promptly. These items should be rectified immediately after
          the last flight of the day in order to avoid any operational
          delays which could occur before the next flight.

.. NOTE:: These checks should be accomplished after the completion of
          the Leaving Airplane (Terminating Flight) Checks listed in
          the Normal Procedures section of the Approved Airplane
          Flight Manual.

.. NOTE:: Refer to Figure 1 or Figure 2 (as applicable) — Recommended
          Walk-Around Sequence
