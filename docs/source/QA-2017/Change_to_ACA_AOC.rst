======================
 Changes to ACA's AOC
======================

Any change affecting the scope of ACAs AOC or the operations
specifications that have been triggered by discoveries through a
quality audit or inspection will require approval by CAAT.

When changes to the AOC are pending the Head of Flight Operations
shall provide the Authority with any relevant documentation. Changes
shall only be implemented upon receipt of formal approval by the
CAAT. ACA understands that we may operate under the conditions
prescribed by the CAAT during such changes, as applicable.

ACA will give the Authority 10 dayâ€™s prior notice of a proposed change
of a Nominated Person unless the circumstances are exceptional.
