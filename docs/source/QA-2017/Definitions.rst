  aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such
  persons have disembarked, in which any person suffers death or serious
  injury as a result of being in or upon the aircraft or anything
  attached thereto, or the aircraft receives substantial damage.

**Acceptable Level of Safety**
  Acceptable level of safety is a level of safety which expressed in
  practical terms by two measures which are safety performance indicator
  and safety performance target.

**Accountable Executive (Accountable Manager)**
  The accountable manager is a single, identifiable person having
  responsibility for the effective and efficient performance of ACA's
  QAS.

**Analysis**
  Analysis is the process of identifying a question or issue to be

  interpreting the results, and possibly making a
  recommendation. Analysis typically involves using scientific or
  mathematical methods for evaluation.

**Assessment**
  Assessment is the process of measuring or judging the value or level of something.

**Audit**
  An audit is a scheduled and a formal review to evaluate compliance
  with ACAs quality standards for our processes, policies, procedures,
  and contractual requirements. ACAs audits may also include compliance
  monitoring.  A compliance monitoring audit will be conducted to ensure
  compliance with CAAT requirements.

The starting point for an audit is the management and operations of
the organization, and it moves outward to the organization's
activities and products/services.

* Internal Audit is an audit conducted by ACA to ensure compliance
  within ACA to ensure compliance with the overseeing authority's
  regulations, and ACA quality policies and procedures.
