==============================
 Compliance Monitoring System
==============================

ACA's compliance monitoring program involves the evaluation of our
processes, policies or procedures to ensure compliance with applicable
rules and regulations of CAAT, State and local laws.  This will be
accomplished by incorporating compliance monitoring when conducting
quality audits and inspections of ACA departments and ACA's contract
service providers.

ACA’s compliance monitoring also involves daily compliance monitoring
by all ACA employees. All operational employees are encouraged to
perform daily compliance monitoring in their assigned duties. If an
employee discovers a non-compliant area they should inform their
immediate supervisor or file a non punitive written report
(Non-compliance Report QAS-1 or a Suggestion Form).

Identifying non-compliant areas is an important step in preserving
ACAs well being and can also help prevent accidents or incidents.

Compliance Monitoring Subject Guide
===================================

.. Note:: the following compliance monitoring subject guide may also
          be used for guidance for audits and inspections.

Non-compliance Identification and Management
============================================

The objective of the non-compliance identification is to identify
those areas of non-compliance which either currently exist and can
cause an immediate threat to the stability of ACA or may pose
potential threat to the stability of ACA in the future. A
non-compliance can be considered a hidden error or threat that has
some level of loss of investment that is associated with it. ACA's QAS
non-compliance process is based on the principle of cause and
effect. All accidents and or occurrences have a root cause and do not
occur by chance.

Given that a non-compliance may involve any situation or condition
that has the potential to cause adverse consequences, the scope for
safety concerns in aviation is wide. The following are some examples:

* Design factors, including equipment and task design;
* Procedures and operating practices, including their documentation
  and checklists, and their validation under actual operating
  conditions;
* Communications, including the medium, terminology and language;
* Personnel factors, such as company policies for recruitment,
  training and remuneration;
* Organizational factors, such as the compatibility of production and
  safety goals, the allocation of resources, operating pressures and
  ACA's quality culture;
* Work environment factors, such as ambient noise and vibration,
  temperature, lighting and the regulatory oversight factors,
  including the applicability and enforceability of regulations; the
  certification of equipment, personnel and procedures; and the
  adequacy of surveillance audits and inspections.

All ACA employees are made aware during their initial and recurrent
training of the State, Local and ACA's overseeing Authority. All
employees are encouraged to report all areas of non-compliance by
filing a Non-compliance Report, Form QAS-1 or Suggestion Form.

Employee Reporting Rights
=========================

Personnel may anonymously report all non-compliance that they discover
using Non-compliance Report, Form QAS-1 or a Suggestion Form. This
reporting system facilitates the collection of data to assist in the
identification of the “root causes,” so that appropriate measures
(training, establishment or modification of procedures, etc.) can be
implemented.

All ACA personnel are required to immediately report any
non-compliance areas that they discover in the work
place. Non-compliance Report, Form QAS-1s and Suggestion Forms are
provided for this purpose.

.. important:: No employee will be disciplined or discharged for
               reporting. ANY non-compliant area that they discover.

Personnel who wish to remain anonymous by submitting a Non-compliance
Report, Form QAS-1 directly to the Head of Quality via the internal
ACA mail system without identifying themselves. The program allows for
anonymous reporting. ACA takes all reports of unsafe conditions
seriously.  The Head of Quality will give prompt attention to all
submitted QAS-1 reports and quality related Suggestion Forms.

.. note:: The Non-compliance Report Form, QAS-1 and Suggestion Forms
  may be printed off from the ACA employee website or may be supplied
  to employees by their department manager or supervisor.

Received Non-compliance Forms, QAS-1
====================================

Completed forms will be forwarded to the Head of Quality. The Head of
Quality shall review all submitted reports and decide if the reported
policy, process or procedures is compliant with applicable regulations
and meets ACA’s operating standards. The Head of Quality may require
more information and interview the employee or observe the employee to
check for compliance. The Head of Quality may decide to conduct an
audit or inspection if they feel that the reported non-compliance or
suggestion is a threat to ACA stability or well being.

If the reported non-compliance does exist, the Head of Quality will
immediately contact the Nominated Person overseeing the department and
advise them of the non-compliance. The Nominated Person will stop
department operations, if the non-compliance severity is estimated to
be a value A or B for the Compliance or Estimated Non-compliance
Severity Table below.

.. note:: The Head of Quality will immediately stop operations if they
  estimated the non-compliance value is an A or B.

All submitted Non-compliance Forms, QAS-1 will be reviewed by the
Quality Assurance Committee. The Quality Assurance Committee will,
consider each reported non-compliance and take the appropriate action,
if it is deemed necessary, to improve the process or procedure and
thus improve quality.


Via mail, written, or in person the Head of Quality will inform the
employee who reported the non-compliance of the action that was taken
to correct the non-compliance or the reasons why the condition was
determined not to be non-compliant.

The Head of Quality will maintain a folder for each month's
Non-compliance Reports, Form QAS-1, and quality related Suggestion
Forms. At the end of the month, the month's folder will be filed in
chronological order for the year.
