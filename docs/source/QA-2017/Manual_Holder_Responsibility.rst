 Manual Holder Responsibility
==============================

Each authorized holder of a Quality Assurance Manual or parts thereof
is personally responsible that their copy is properly amended and/or
revised. This is to be documented by filling in the revision record
which is part of each copy. Each manual holder may be subject to
scheduled audits or unscheduled inspections to verify that their copy
of the QM is up-to-date. Non-conformities shall be reported to the
Head of Quality.
