 Inspections
=============

All departments within the ACA are subject to be inspected. An
inspection is unscheduled or unannounced check of ACA departmental
operations or our contract services providers operations. The
inspection confirms that ACA or our contract services provider's
processes, policies or procedures are compliant with ACA standards and
compliant with CAAT requirements. The main purpose of an inspection is
to identify unsatisfactory practices before they cause an accident.

ACA's QAS inspection program aim is to improve ACA's by raising the
quality standards of all ACA departments and contract service
providers by auditing, inspecting and monitoring their processes,
policies and procedures. The QAS inspection program compares the
performance of all ACA departments and contract service providers by
scoring them against the estimated compliance or non-compliance
severity table. All ACA departments and contract service providers are
expected to attain levels of at least compliance with the compliance
or non-compliance severity table. ACA's QAS inspection program is
meant to help and encourage all ACA departments and contract service
providers to achieve levels of compliance. The non-compliance process
describes how the ACA deals with departments and contract service
providers that do not achieve compliance.

The Quality Assurance System Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3 contains
Compliance or Estimated Non Compliance Severity Values that consists
of values of A, B, C, D and E. The Auditor or Inspector will circle
that value that, in their judgment, indicates that the area that was
inspected was found to be compliant or non-compliant. The auditor or
inspector will then add the discrepancies that were found and what
they believe is the root cause of the discovered
non-compliance(s). The audit or inspection will be considered a pass
if NO non-compliance(s) are found. The audit or inspection will be
considered a fail if any non-compliance(s) are found.

.. Note:: See Non-Compliant Findings and Quality Assurance Committee
          Meetings sections for expanded non-compliant findings and
          corrective actions.

The same forms will be used to conduct an Inspection that is used to
conduct and Audit.

1. Audit or Inspection Checklist Form QAS-2;
2. Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3;
3. Audit or Inspection Report Form QAS-4.

Audit or Inspection Checklists, Form QAS-2 are required to be
completed before conducting Inspections. The Quality Audit or
Inspection Form QAS-3 is required to be completed and shall be
delivered to the Head of Quality within 48 hrs of completing the
Inspection.

.. Note:: Inspections will be used as an immediate reaction to a
          Non-compliance Report that has been received and determined
          to be an Excessive Non-compliance by a Nominated Person or
          the Head of Quality. The Audit or Inspection Checklist Form
          QAS-2 will be forgone in the case of an excessive
          non-compliance report.

All forms used during the inspection shall be delivered to the Head of
Quality within 48 hr of completing the Inspection.

    be considered.

The Inspector will allocate sufficient planning time in advance of the
inspection to ensure that the inspection is conducted in accordance
with ACA Compliance Monitoring / QAS Inspection Procedures and to
achieve the required objectives. The planning time should ideally be
one day and conducted on the day prior to the commencement of the
inspection. However, should longer be considered necessary, then
approval is required from the Head of Quality.

Note: If a non-compliance finding had significant flight safety
implications, the Inspector should immediately the Nominated Person
overseeing the department, the department manager or supervisor and

applied by ACA will be submitted to the Inspector. External Inspectors
have to satisfy necessary qualifications for Inspector

Inspection Preparation
======================

When preparing for the inspection, it is important to establish the following:

1. Inspection plan to include entry and exit meetings;

2. Objectives and scope;

3. Inspection staff required;

4. Accommodation requirements;

5. Required documentation;

6. Access to controlled environments.

The following forms are to be used:

1. Non-compliance Report, Form QAS-1;

2. Audit or Inspection Checklist Form QAS-2;

3. Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3;

4. Audit or Inspection Report Form QAS-4.

The Inspector is to ensure that the inspection objectives are fully
developed before beginning the inspection begins.

The Inspector will fully familiarize themselves with the required
standards and obtain the required documentation. If no standard exists
for a particular area, then familiarization with the existing
procedure is required.

Once the Inspector is in possession of required documentation and is
fully familiar with the area to be inspected, they allocate the tasks
and decide which Inspectors are to perform which tasks.

After completing and getting acquainted with the documents, the Head
of Quality shall organize a meeting with the Inspector and the
Inspectors for a short briefing about that particular Inspection. The
date and time of the meeting is set forth in the document naming the
Inspector/Inspectors, which is delivered to them after the Head of
Quality has formed the Inspection Team.

Techniques Which Contribute to an Effective Inspection
======================================================

The following techniques may contribute to the effectiveness of an
inspection are:

* Interviews or discussions with departmental personnel;

* A review of published documents and CAAT requirements;

* The examination of an adequate sample of records, documents and logs;


* The witnessing of processes, activities and procedures which make up
  the operation;

* The preservation of documents and the recording of observations.

Data Gathering Guidelines
=========================

The conduct of the inspection is to include the following considerations.

The Inspector is responsible for ensuring the inspection achieves the
required objectives.

* Follow the inspection plan as closely as possible.

* Answer all the questions on the Audit or Inspection Checklist Form, QAS-2.

* The inspection may require a variation to the initial inspection plan.

* Make observations and record all quality concerns and / or
  non-compliant areas as appropriate on Audit or Inspection Checklist
  Form, QAS-2 and Audit or Inspection Form, QAS-3.

* Schedule Inspection update meetings with the Head of Quality to ask
  questions or take council.

* If the inspection takes longer than one day, the Inspector is to
  provide a summary of the daily findings to the responsible Nominated
  Persons, department managers or supervisors.

* The use of "guides" to introduce Inspectors to required personnel,
  locate particular documentation and answer any questions, is generally
  a normal practice, however, they can be externally valuable as
  witnesses when nonconformities are identified. The role of the
  "guides" is to ensure that the Inspectors are able to move around
  freely, are accompanied at all times to meet with company
  confidentiality and health and safety requirements and to ensure that
  fair play prevails.

* Provide positive reactions and comments of findings to the responsible
  Nominated Persons, managers or supervisors.

Should any other aspects be observed which whilst not being
nonconformity could be a cause for concern; these are to be reported
immediately to the responsible Nominated Person, department manager or
supervisor.

All the findings are to be collected together, utilizing the, Audit or
Inspection Checklist; Form QAS-2, Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3,
Audit or Inspection Report Form QAS-4.

Reporting Findings
==================

When the inspection has concluded the Inspector shall brief the
Inspected of all findings. Should the Inspected refuse to accept the
Inspector’s findings, the final decision regarding the validity of a
specific finding shall be made by the Quality Assurance Committee.

* Subsequent to an inspection, the Inspector will record and report:

* The seriousness of the findings;

* The need for immediate corrective action;

* The origin of the finding;

* Initiates procedures to ensure that corrective actions are
  implemented such that the non-conformity does not recur;


* A schedule for corrective action;

* Identify the individual responsible for implementing corrective
  action;

* That the corrective action process is correctly implemented and completed;


* The effectiveness of corrective action through the re inspection
  process; Report any corrective actions that are not being closed
  within the defined time scale to the Head of Quality;

* Notifying the Head of Quality in the first instance of any
  requirement for additional resources;

* All non-compliant items are reviewed by the Head of Quality for
  their degree of importance and the allocated time scale for
  rectification.

* The Inspector shall submit the QAS-2, Audit or Inspection Checklist;
  QAS-3, Audit or Inspection Form; QAS-4, Audit or Inspection Report
  to the Head of Quality within 48 hours.

Data Analysis
=============

This is a critical component of ACA's QAS. The Head of Quality and
Quality Assurance Committee will review all Non-compliance Forms,
QAS-1, Safety Inspection Forms and Reports. Tracking and analyzing
data is used to enhance our awareness of all non-compliant areas
within ACA of our contract service providers. This screening and
decision process will evaluate the data for significance applied to
all incoming data. We collect and analyze quality data as described in
this manual and support the sharing of the data to continually improve
ACA's level of overall quality.

This quality information is used to:

* Identify risks and verify the effectiveness of implemented controls;

* Identify areas in which quality could be improved;

* Contribute to accident and incident prevention;

* Assess the effectiveness of training

Both the Head of Quality and Quality Assurance Committee are
responsible for analyzing quality data to identify adverse trends and
to identify indicators of potential quality issues.

Over a period of time, this data will help identify indicators that
point to potential problems in the system before they occur.

Inspection Closing Meeting
==========================

An inspection closing meeting is held to close the inspection. In
attendance would be the same personnel as for the inspection entry
meeting. The Inspector as chairman and supported by their team will
provide the inspected with the initial findings of the inspection,
accompanied by any other relevant comments.


The inspected will be made aware as to the documented process
following on from the inspection exit meeting; this will ensure that
they understand what is required of them in order for the inspection
process to be completed. The inspected and inspector will agree upon a
date that all findings will be corrected.  All reports will be
delivered to the Head of Quality.

Non-Compliant Findings
======================

Value A or B Non-Compliant Findings
-----------------------------------

All non compliant finding will be logged on Audit or Inspection Form
QAS-3 and the Audit or Inspection Report QAS-4. All non-compliant
items will be reviewed by the Inspector and the Head of Quality. The
Head of Quality will determine the non-compliant value of each
non-compliant process, policy or procedure that was found during the
inspection. If the non-compliant value is determined to be an A or B,
the Head of Quality will immediately notify the Nominated Person that
is responsible for the department and immediately stop all department
operations. The Nominated Person for the department will enact a
temporary new process, policy or procedure with the approval of the
Head of Quality. The Nominated Person of the department will be
responsible for any temporary revision to all affected manuals and for
dissemination of all temporary revisions.

The Safety Manage will call an emergency Quality Assurance Committee
meeting. The Quality Assurance Committee will review the non-compliant
findings and agree on a new process, policy or procedure for the
department. The procedure will be immediately implement the corrective
action and is responsible for the revision process for all affected
manuals.

Value C, D or E Non-Compliant Findings
--------------------------------------

The Quality Assurance Committee will review all Value C, D or E
non-compliant findings at the scheduled monthly meeting and agree upon
any corrective actions that may be required.

Quality Assurance Committee Meetings
====================================

Quality Assurance Committee meetings provide organizational control
and continual quality improvement are made. The Quality Assurance
Committee meeting is a formal meeting of all Nominated Persons and
invited department managers, supervisors and Fight Crews. To be
effective, a formal Quality Assurance Committee review take place on a
