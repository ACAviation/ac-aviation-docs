Audits
======

An audit is scheduled check of ACA departmental operations or our
contract services providers operations. Audits help to confirm that
ACA or our contract services provider's processes, policies or
procedures are compliant with ACA standards and compliant with CAAT
requirements.

ACAs audits may also include compliance monitoring.  A compliance
monitoring audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with CAAT
requirements.

Audits are used to confirm that processes, policies, resources,
procedures and results are focused and relevant to the ACA's
operation. The main purpose of an audit is to identify unsatisfactory
practices before they cause an accident. Audits will be carried out in
accordance with the Audit Schedule.

Checklists are required to be completed before conducting Audits. The
Quality Audit or Inspection Form is required and shall be delivered to
the Head of Quality within 48hr of completing the Audit.

The Head of Quality shall monitor the effectiveness of the Audit
Schedule, if required; changes are to be effected through the Quality
Assurance Committee review process.

-----------
Audit Types
-----------

Quality Audits
--------------

A Quality Audit is a scheduled and a formal review to evaluate
compliance with ACAs quality standards for our processes, policies,
procedures, and contractual requirements.  Quality audits cover
internal, ACA operations, and external, contract service providers
operations.

Compliance Monitoring Audits
----------------------------

A Compliance Monitoring audit is a scheduled and a formal review to
evaluate compliance with CAAT requirements.

Internal Audits
---------------

Internal audits are scheduled and conducted by ACA's Head of Quality
to ensure that ACA's process, policies and procedures meet the
requirements of ACA and that all applicable CAAT are being complied
with.

Department Internal Self Audits
-------------------------------

All Nominated Persons, department managers and supervisors are
encouraged to conduct department internal self audits. This is a tool
we employ to measure safety margins of processes, policies and
procedures within the department at ACA.

Department internal self audits are still considered a formal process
and will follow the processes, policies, procedures and complete all
forms that would be used in a scheduled audit.

External Audits

External audits are undertaken by ACA's quality department to ensure
that our contracted service providers process, policies and procedures
meet the requirements of ACA and that all applicable CAAT are being
complied with.

Follow Up Audits
----------------

This audit is required as part of the corrective action verification
process.

Management Evaluation Audits
----------------------------

All Nominated Persons are aware that they themselves and the
departments that they are subject to audits and inspections to ensure
their commitment to ACA's QAS.

In ACA it is called the Quality Assurance Committee review process and
it considers:

* The results of audits or inspections, safety reports, operational
  analyses and any other information sources.
* The overall effectiveness of the management organization in achieving
  its stated safety objectives.

The Accountable Manager assumes the overall responsibility for
ensuring that all Nominated Persons are committed to ACA's Quality
Assurance System policies, procedures and the constant improvement of
safety throughout the company.

Specialist Advice
=================

ACA Auditors and Inspectors cannot be experts in every field related
to the operational environment. It is important that they realize
their limitations. When necessary, they must be willing to consult
with other professionals during an audit or evaluation. ACA may
utilize the following specific sources of information:

* Mandatory reporting programs;
* Voluntary Reporting Program;
* The external audit process;
* Accident and incident investigations;
* Data analysis;
* Change management;
* Internal Audit and Inspections;
* Continuous Monitoring

ACA actively seeks the information necessary to confirm the successful
operation of our QAS processes. Continuous monitoring involves
analysis of operational data as it becomes available. The operational
data is continually monitored to discover any pertinent trends. The
Head of Quality is responsible to monitor this information and
accomplish this review on a weekly basis.

Audit Planning
==============

This form is completed in order to establish the overall audit
requirements for a particular year.

The form includes the schedule area and months and whenever an area is
required to be audited in the particular month, the area audit code is
inserted. To identify which area is to be audited during a particular
month, refer to Audit Schedule Plan. A blank space means that there is
no audit requirement for the particular area during the month in
question.

Document reference at the bottom left indicates the reference for the
particular form.

Audit Scheduling
================

The Quality Assurance System contains audit schedule and periodic review details.

The schedule is flexible and unscheduled audits can be completed when
required by adverse trends.

Follow-up audits are scheduled to ensure that corrective action has
been effective.

All topics are audited with a frequency no greater than 12
months. Audit frequency should not be extended without the specific
agreement of the Authority.

In the event the Audit is not performed according to the Audit plan
for the year, the Head of Quality shall decide whether the Audit will
be postponed or cancelled.

The schedule for each defined area shall include:

a) The Month of Audit;

b) Regulations to be covered in the Audit

c) Checklist.

Audit Schedule Control
======================

This system ensures that all requirements of the audit schedule and
plans are achieved and control the day to day operation.

The system is the responsibility of the Auditor and is subject to
constant review in order to achieve required goals.

ACA Audit Program
=================

ACA's Quality Assurance System (QAS) and Compliance Monitoring (CM)
audit programs aim is to improve ACA's by raising the quality and
compliance standards of all ACA departments and contract service
providers.  The QAS / CM audit program compare the performance of all
ACA departments and contract service providers by scoring them against
the estimated compliance or non-compliance severity table. All ACA
departments and contract service providers are expected to attain
levels of at least compliance with the compliance or non-compliance
severity table. ACA's QAS / CM audit program are meant to help and
encourage all ACA departments and contract service providers to
achieve levels of compliance. The non-compliance process describes how
the ACA deals with departments and contract service providers that do
not achieve compliance.

The Quality Assurance System Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3 contains
an Estimated Concern or Non Compliance Severity Values that consists
of values of A, B, C, D and E. The Auditor or Inspector will circle
that value that, in their judgment, indicates that the area that was
audited was found to be compliant or non-compliant. The auditor or
inspector will then add the discrepancies that were found and what
they believe is the root cause of the discovered
non-compliance(s). The audit or inspection will be considered a pass
if NO non-compliance(s) are found. The audit or inspection will be
considered a fail if any non-compliance(s) are found.

Note: Form QAS-3 will be used for Quality Audits / Inspections and
Compliance Audits / Inspections.

The Nominated Person, Department Manager or Supervisor will be
notified of passing or failing the audit or inspection. Any ACA
departments and contract service providers which fail an audit or
inspection to adequately address all non-compliance's within the
agreed upon corrective action and implantation time frame that has
been agreed upon by the Quality Assurance Committee.

.. Note:: See Non-Compliant Findings and Quality Assurance Committee
          Meetings sections for expanded non-compliant findings and
          corrective actions.

Audit Preparation
=================

When preparing for the audit, it is important to establish the following:

1. Audit plan to include entry and exit meetings;
2. Objectives and scope;
3. Audit staff required;
4. Accommodation requirements;
5. Required documentation;

The following forms are to be used:

1. Non-compliance Report, Form QAS-1;
2. Audit or Inspection Checklist Form QAS-2;
3. Audit or Inspection Form QAS-3;
4. Audit or Inspection Report Form QAS-4.

The Auditor is to ensure that the audit objectives are fully developed
before beginning the audit begins.

The Auditor will fully familiarize themselves with the required
standards and obtain the required documentation. If no standard exists
for a particular area, then familiarization with the existing
procedure is required.

Once the Auditor is in possession of required documentation and is
fully familiar with the area to be inspected, they allocate the tasks
and decide which Auditors are to perform which tasks.

After completing and getting acquainted with the documents, the Head
of Quality shall organize a meeting with the Auditor and the Auditors
for a short briefing about that particular audit. The date and time of
the meeting is set forth in the document naming the Auditor/Auditors,
which is delivered to them after the Head of Quality has formed the
audit team.

Audit Notification
==================

The Auditor will contact the Nominated Person or the person in charge
of the department and inform them of the audit. An Audit Notification
Form will be sent to the person in charge of the department. A day and
time will be agreed upon to conduct the audit. The Auditor will
complete the Audit Notification Forma and place it in the Audit File /
Folder.

Audit Entry Meeting
===================

The aim of the meeting is to establish the audit plan, scope,
objectives and domestic arrangements. The length of the meeting is
determined by the size of the audit, but should not take longer than
15 minutes, particularly as all the pre-audit work will have been
completed and involved the audited as appropriate.

Beginning the Audit
===================

Upon the commencement of the audit, an introductory meeting is to be
conducted by the Auditor, accompanied by their team, with the audited
management (senior management of the area being audited, together with
any other pertinent persons).

Techniques Which Contribute to an Effective Audit
=================================================

Techniques which contribute to an effective audit are:

1. Interviews or discussions with departmental personnel;
2. A review of published documents and CAAT requirements;
3. The examination of an adequate sample of records, documents and logs;
4. The witnessing of processes, activities and procedures which make
   up the operation;
5. The preservation of documents and the recording of observations.

Data Gathering Guidelines
=========================

The conduct of the audit is to include the following considerations.

1. The Auditor is responsible for ensuring the audit achieves the
   required objectives.
2. Follow the audit plan as closely as possible.
3. Answer all the questions on the primary checklist, Audit or Inspection
   Checklist Form, QAS-2.
4. The audit may require a variation to the initial audit plan due to
   unexpected occurrences.
5. Make observations and record all quality concerns and / or
   non-compliant areas as appropriate on Audit or Inspection Checklist
   Form, QAS-2 and Audit or Inspection Form, QAS-3.
6. If the audit takes longer than one day, the Auditor is to provide a
   daily summary of findings to the Nominated Persons, department
   managers and / or supervisors.
7. The use of "guides" to introduce Auditors to required personnel,
   locate particular documentation and answer any questions, is generally
   a normal practice, however, they can be externally valuable as
   witnesses when nonconformities are identified. The role of the
   "guides" is to ensure that the Auditors are able to move around
   freely, are accompanied at all times to meet with company
   confidentiality and health and safety requirements and to ensure that
   fair play prevails.
8. Provide positive reactions and comments of findings to the responsible
   Nominated Persons, managers or supervisors.

Should any other aspects be observed which whilst not being
nonconformity could be a cause for concern; these are to be reported
immediately to the responsible Nominated Person, department manager or
supervisor.

All the findings are to be collected together, utilizing the QAS-2,
Audit or Inspection Checklist; QAS-3, Audit or Inspection Form; QAS-4,
Audit or Inspection Report.

Reporting Findings
==================

When the audit has concluded the Auditor shall brief the Audited of
all findings. Should the Audited refuse to accept the Auditor’s
findings, the final decision regarding the validity of a specific
finding shall be made by the Quality Assurance Committee.

The Auditor will record and report:

1. The seriousness of the findings;
2. The need for immediate corrective action;
3. The origin of the finding;
4. Initiates procedures to ensure that corrective actions are implemented
   such that the non-conformity does not recur;

   action;
7. That the corrective action process is correctly implemented and completed;
8. The effectiveness of corrective action through the re audit process;
9. Report any corrective actions that are not being closed within the
   defined time scale to the Head of Quality;
10. Notifying the Head of Quality in the first instance of any requirement
    for additional resources;
11. All non-compliance items are reviewed by the Head of Quality for their
    degree of importance and the allocated time scale for rectification.

    QAS-3, Audit or Inspection Form; QAS-4, Audit or Inspection Report to
    the Head of Quality within 48 hours.

Data Analysis
=============

Data analysis is a critical component of ACA's QAS. The Head of
Quality and Quality Assurance Committee will review all Non-compliance
Forms, QAS-1, Safety Audit Forms and Reports. Tracking and analyzing
data is used to enhance our awareness of non-compliant areas within
ACA or our contract service providers. This screening and decision
process will evaluate the data for significance applied to all
incoming data. We collect and analyze safety data as described in this
manual and support the sharing of the data to continually improve
ACA's level of overall quality.

This safety information is used to:

1. Identify risks and verify the effectiveness of implemented controls;
2. Identify areas in which safety could be improved;
3. Contribute to accident and incident prevention;
4. Assess the effectiveness of training

Both the Head of Quality and Quality Assurance Committee are
responsible for analyzing quality data to identify adverse trends and
to identify indicators of potential quality issues.

Over a period of time, this data will help identify indicators that
point to potential problems in the system before they occur.

Audit Closing Meeting
=====================

An audit closing meeting is held to close the audit. In attendance
would be the same personnel as for the audit entry meeting. The
Auditor as chairman and supported by their team will provide the
inspected with the initial findings of the audit, accompanied by any
other relevant comments.

The inspected will be made aware as to the documented process
following on from the audit exit meeting; this will ensure that they
understand what is required of them in order for the audit process to
be completed. The inspected and inspector will agree upon a date that
all findings will be corrected.

All reports, forms and logs will be turned into the Head of Quality.

Non-Compliant Findings
