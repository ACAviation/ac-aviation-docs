 Introduction
==============

The Quality Assurance Manual enables AC Aviation to monitor compliance
with CAAT requirements and the guidance set forth in ICAO Doc 9859
AN/474, (Quality Assurance Manual QAM) and the AOC issue by the CAAT.

1. AC Aviation has taken into account human factors principles when
   creating the QAM.  The Head of Quality shall ensure that the QAM is
   maintained in a form in which it can be used without difficulty.

2. AC Aviation shall utilize our Quality Assurance System (QAS) to
   assess reported or discovered non-compliance related to AC Aviation
   flight and maintenance operations.

3. AC Aviation QAS addresses the formal and systematic approach to
   overall quality and its related processes and activities rather
   than occupational quality, environmental protection, or customer
   service quality.

4. AC Aviation will provide oversight for the quality of our
   contracted service providers policies and procedures.  The Head of
   Quality will schedule audits and coordinated inspections for all
   contracted service providers to ensure compliance with AC Aviation
   quality standards.

5. AC Aviation understands that we may issue a Quality Assurance
   Manual in separate volumes.  With the approval of the Authority,
   copies of the Quality Assurance Manual may be distributed to
   Company personnel in an electronic format which may be accessed
   through AC Aviation employeeâ€™s website.
