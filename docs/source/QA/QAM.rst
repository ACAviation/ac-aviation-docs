The Revision Process
====================

When a revision is required, Nominated Persons or the person
overseeing the department may request a revision to the ACA QAM.  The
person will forward the revision request to the Head of Flight
Operations and the Head of Quality stating the reason for the
revision.

If a person overseeing the department requests a revision, they will
follow their chain of command as depicted in the QAS, Organization and
Responsibilities section, Organization Structure Diagram.

As an example, the Head of Quality may require a change to ACA's to
Risk Assessment process. The Head of Quality will advise the Head of
Flight Operations of the revision. The Head of Flight Operations will
call a Quality Assurance Committee meeting to discuss and deliberate
ACA's Risk Assessment process.

Once the revision of policies and or procedures has been agreed upon
by the Quality Assurance Committee, the Head of Quality will compose
the revision and then email or disseminate a draft of the revision to
the Quality Assurance Committee for review. The Quality Assurance
Committee may request changes or clarification on the drafts policies
and procedures. The Head of Quality is responsible for the changes or
any required clarification. Once a final draft is agreed upon, the
Head of Quality will forward the revision to the Head of Flight
Operations who in term will alert all affected employees of the
revision via email or via the ACA employee website. All affected
employees will print of the revision, sign and date the revision and
forward the signed revision to their immediate supervisor. The

Person overseeing the department. Nominated Person's will advise the
Head of Quality of all signed revisions and place all signed revisions
in the employee file which will be kept until the employee leaves ACA.
